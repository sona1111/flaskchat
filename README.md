flaskchat
=========

Base application for flask website using socketio and mongodb

flaskchat.wsgi will run the server on port 4448. Things are basic and inefficient at this early stage. Mongo is not implemented as of yet, it just connects and that's it. Logout it only implemented by timeout (universal)

Next release:
-logout via button
-logout via browser events
-mongo logging of chat window
-better looking login page!
